I'm beginning this project at 9:50pm, September 8th 2021. I'm sitting in the clubhouse study room. My current job is quite draining so I'm pursuing a career in web development. I find web development quite intelectually stimulating and after a lot of research, the working style seems to suit me better too. 

Not sure what I'm going to learn for this specific project yet, just starting it! I'll reflect when I'm done :) Good luck, Tak!
