    <p>Hassle free, no fancy equipment needed. A recipe that'll certainly impress your partner, friends and family.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2  cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>⅔  cup sugar</li>
        <li>⅛  teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
        <li>6  large egg yolks</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            In a small pot, simmer heavy cream, milk, sugar and salt until sugar completely dissolves, about 5 minutes. Remove pot from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a separate bowl, whisk yolks. Whisking constantly, slowly whisk about a third of the hot cream into the yolks, then whisk the yolk mixture back into the pot with the cream.
        </li>
        <li>
            Return pot to medium-low heat and gently cook until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon (about 170 degrees on an instant-read thermometer).
        </li>
        <li>
            Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. Cool mixture to room temperature.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover and chill at least 4 hours or overnight. Churn in an ice cream machine according to manufacturers’ instructions. Serve directly from the machine for soft serve, or store in freezer until needed.
        </li>
    </ol>
