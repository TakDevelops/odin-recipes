    <h2>Grandma Lee's Pork Chive Dumpling Recipe</h2>
    <p>To me, dumplings are little balls of love. My Nai Nai always made them when I was growing up. Every Chinese New Year, my uncle and I would have dumpling eating competitions to see who can eat the most number of dumplings.
        Dumpling wrapping was also a family bonding activity! This recipe is straight from my Nai Nai's heart, made with love.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 packet dumpling pastry, about 24 pieces (available at Asian store)</li>
        <li>220g mince pork</li>
        <li>135g Chinese chives（韭菜)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp light soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tsp cornflour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp chicken powder (chicken bouillon powder)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse chives and pat dry with kitchen papers. Chop into small pieces.</li>
        <li>Mix mince pork with seasonings well and combine with chives thoroughly. Chill in refrigerator for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Prepare a little bowl of water for sealing dumplings. Place a heaped teaspoon of filling into the center of the dumpling pastry.</li>
        <li>Damp the edge with water and seal it tightly. (View the video below to see how to pleat a dumpling.)</li>
        <li>Heat up a bit of oil in a non-stick frying-pan. Place dumplings in a single layer without touching with each other. Fry them in batches until the bottom is light brown. Add 1/4 cup of boiling water, cover with a lid and cook until the water dries up. Dish up and serve with soy sauce, chili sauce or vinegar.</li>
    </ol>
